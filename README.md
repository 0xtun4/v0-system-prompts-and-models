# FULL v0 and Cursor System Prompts and AI models

I managed to get ~~a big part of~~ FULL official v0 and Cursor (Sonnet-3.7 based) system prompts and AI models. Over 3k lines

# There have been some allegations of the VP of AI of v0, Jared Palmer, saying that the system prompt is a hallucination. I can ensure it is NOT, and that he's lying. Check this out: https://x.com/viarnes/status/1898078086798901329?s=46


# What do you want to see next? ---> Open an issue.

LATEST UPDATE: 08/03/2025

You can check it out in v0.txt, v0 model.txt, v0 tools.txt, cursor agent.txt, cursor ask.txt (soon) and cursor edit.txt (soon)

~~And now the question is, what model is v0 using? soon. ðŸ‘€~~ v0 AI MODELS INFO RELEASED! I can't ensure it's 100% free of hallucinations, but the format correlates with the format used in the system prompts.
